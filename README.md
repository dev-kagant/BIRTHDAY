## **Kerri's Many Thought**
#### I was expecting to get this back to you all a litte sooner, but it has been a jam packed week, since last week and I lost internet for a whole day which wasn't ideal. Regardless, I really wanted to try to stick to the alotted 2 hours but I did go over a little. I was having quite a bid of trouble getting consistant responses from the API calls. They come through but not all the time, think its soemthing wrong with my computer, cause I would have to restart. So, I ended up using the sample data you all provide. I was able to grab the information from the data and complete the following requirements:
* displaying of the exchange rates in USD
* Only seeing crypto currencies
* And being able to filter by name, forward and backwards **Just click Twice
#### Unfornately without being able to get a successful connection to the API I was not able to get the information needed for the last two features. I didn't have much time to add design elements to the project, something I really do enjoy, but I believe the projects on my resume give a pretty good representation of my abilities with CSS and similar frameworks.


## **How to Use**
1. After downloading the zip folder and extrating the files you will need to navigate to the Birthday-Challenge folder within your terminal
2. Run the following commands "npm install" or "yarn install" to download all dependencies
3. Once those are done: run "npm start" or "yarn start" to start the application and it should automatically open a web-browswer but if it doesn't just paste the following into your web-browser "localhost:3000"
4. Once on the website you will see the information for the features listed above
5. To sort the information alphabetically just click the button at the top of the page, and clicking it again will reverse the order.



## **Future Features**
1. Design page layout
2. Addig increase and descrease values
3. comparing to the magnitude of the delta
